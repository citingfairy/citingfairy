## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there, I'm Nils, a media historian of 20th Century Europe.

I love meddling with digital workflows. I want to share some products of this experimentation here. I'm also learning Python right now in order to be able to hop on the Digital Humanities train.

Feel free to contact me here or via mail@nilsbuehler.de, I'd love to share experiences!
